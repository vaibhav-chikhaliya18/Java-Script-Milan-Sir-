# **Product Search Website**

This repository contains the code for a simple JavaScript website that allows users to search for different phones or products. The website uses an API to retrieve the product data, and it displays the results in a list. When a user clicks on a product, a modal appears that contains more details about the product. The website also has a search bar that allows users to search for specific products. If no results are found, a spinner will be displayed to indicate that the data is being loaded.

The website is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript ES6, Tailwind CSS, Daisy UI, Node app, and VS Code.
